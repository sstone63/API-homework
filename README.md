Data Trends:

1: Max Temperature decreases as Latitude increases. There is a slight dip in temperature below the equator as the Latitude heads toward the South Pole as well.

2. Humidity is far more prevalent around the equator, as this is where the vast majority of temperate rainforests are located.

3. Wind Speed is much lower around the equator, and increases sharply the closer to the arctic circle the data points are.
